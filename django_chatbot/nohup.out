I'm alone at a party and need to get back to my dorm.
[]
Time for response time: 2.3989787101745605


System: It's always a good idea to go to parties with a friend, but if you find yourself alone and need to get back to your dorm safely, there are a few things you can do. First, make sure you have enough change for a phone call or have a ride arranged beforehand. If you're walking, try to stick to well-lit areas and avoid dark streets. Keep a firm grip on your belongings and be aware of your surroundings. If you feel uncomfortable or sense trouble, leave the area immediately. It's also a good idea to carry your keys in your hand so you can quickly get into your dorm. If you're feeling intimidated, yelling "Fire!" can be more effective than yelling for help. And remember, you can always contact Campus Safety for assistance.
